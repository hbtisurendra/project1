# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

## About the project

* In the MyReads project, we'll create a bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books we have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

* The main page has three shelves that users are able to move the books between shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. After selecting books to add to shelves, when you navigate back to the home page the you can instantly see the selections made on the search page. This project uses React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.
